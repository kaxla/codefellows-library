codefellows-library
===================

I tried this two different ways and couldn't get either to work. I don't have any more time to spend on this though so hopefully what I have can demonstrate to you that I can learn this, just not by myself. (See f6s messages sent to Will for more info) 

library.rb is trying to make the library 1 big hash where the titles of books is the key and the shelf name is the value. I ultimately decided this a) wouldn't work and b) was not what you were asking for. So I tried again with:

Library2.rb is just a hot mess of "serious misunderstandings about the purpose of OOP" as someone on stack overflow so helpfully put it. So there you go.
